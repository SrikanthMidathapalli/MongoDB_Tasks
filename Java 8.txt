1. What are the main features introduced in Java 8?h-1,S-1/2,J-1,A-1
Answer: Java 8 introduced lambda expressions, the Stream API, default methods, and the java.util.function package, among other features.

2. What is a lambda expression, and how is it used in Java 8?h-1,S-1,J-1,A-1
Answer: A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function. It allows you to pass behavior to functions and methods. 
Example: (a, b) -> a + b

3. What is the Stream API in Java 8, and how does it differ from collections?h-1,S-1,J-1,A-1
Answer: The Stream API allows for functional-style operations on collections of data. Unlike collections, 
streams do not store data; they represent a sequence of elements and support operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

4. Explain the concept of functional interfaces in Java 8.h-1,S-1,J-1,A-1
Answer: Functional interfaces have a single abstract method and can be used with lambda expressions. Examples include Runnable, Consumer, and Predicate.

5. How do you use method references in Java 8?h-1/2,S-1/2,A-1
Answer: Method references provide a shorthand notation for invoking methods using lambda expressions. There are three types: 
static method references, instance method references, and constructor references.

6. What are default methods in Java 8, and why were they introduced?h-1,S-0,j-1,A-0
Answer: Default methods allow interfaces to have method implementations. They were introduced to provide backward compatibility for existing 
code when new methods are added to interfaces.

7. What is the purpose of the map operation in the Stream API?h-1,S-0,J-1,A-1
Answer: The map operation transforms each element of a stream into another object using the provided function.

8. How do you filter elements in a stream using the filter operation?h-1,S-1/2,j-1,A-1
- Answer: The filter operation allows you to specify a predicate to retain only the elements that satisfy the 
given condition.

9. What is the purpose of the distinct operation in the Stream API?h-1,S-1,j=0,A-1
- Answer: The distinct operation removes duplicate elements from a stream, ensuring that each element is unique.

10.Explain the concept of parallel streams in Java 8.h-1,S-0,j-1/2,A-1.2
- Answer: Parallel streams allow for concurrent processing of data by splitting the data into multiple threads, 
potentially improving performance on multi-core processors.

11. What are the benefits of using the new Date and Time API introduced in Java 8?h-1,S-1
- Answer: The new Date and Time API (java.time) provides improved date and time handling, immutability,
 and better support for time zones.
